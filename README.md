# SkynetLive

Skynet live is meant to be a debugging tool for embedded projects that have fairly
high speed data being sent over a serial port.  It interfaces with the normal Skynet
protocol and also introduces a new, high speed protocol that is simply sending a
single struct with no other additional information.

It is created in the QT framework.
